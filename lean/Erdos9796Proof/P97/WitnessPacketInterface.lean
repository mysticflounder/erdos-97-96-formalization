# Witness-packet interfaces for the two-circle leaves

This module formalizes the *input-side* interfaces that the two-circle crossing
reductions in `TwoCircleCrossing.lean` consume.  It introduces the **selected
class** vocabulary (`T_s` of the prose `docs/97-full-prose-proof-draft.md`) — the
`K4` equidistance class of a centre — and packages, over that vocabulary, the
two configurations the reductions reject:

* the **U2 base-chord witness packet** (`U2a2-1b4c2e2d3f0`/`d3f1a`) and its
  contradiction (`d3f1c`/`d3f1d`);
* the **U1 opposed-order blocker configuration** (`U1m-c1a1a`/`b`/`c1`) and its
  contradiction, built through `OpposedOrderCrossingLedger`.

What is **proved** here is the *contradiction-given-configuration* direction:
once the relevant points are exhibited as members of two distinct selected
classes sharing two endpoints plus a strict off-chord third point, the kernel
forecloses it.  This is exactly the bridge that was missing — it ties the
abstract `Sphere` circles of `TwoCircleCrossing.lean` to genuine `K4`
equidistance classes inside the point set `A`.

What is **not** proved here is the *production* direction — that the cap/witness
configuration actually yields a packet/config of the required shape:

* U2 (`d3f1b`, "strict interior witness count"): that the strict member of the
  selected class `T_s` also lies on the exact opposite-cap class.
* U1 (`U1m-c1a1c2` derivation): that the opposed endpoint-order row of the
  cross-cap blocker ping-pong produces the strict off-chord common point.  This
  needs the ordered-cap endpoint machinery (`EndpointUsed`, `RankInterval`, the
  source/target push toward opposite cap ends) from `U1k-b`/`U1m-b0`/`U1m-b1c`/
  `U1m-c1a0`, which is not yet formalized in Lean.

Those production steps remain prose-only obligations; this module does not state
their antecedents (doing so faithfully requires the unformalized machinery
above) and does not discharge them.  See `docs/97-uniform-theorem-closure-plan.md`.

All declarations are axiom-clean (`{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`).

/-- The **selected class** centred at `s` with radius `d`: the points of `A` at
distance `d` from `s`.  When its cardinality is at least `4` it is a `K4`
equidistance witness at `s` (`HasNEquidistantPointsAt 4 A s` with this radius).
This is the "selected class centred at `s`" / `T_s` of the prose

different centres are different spheres, irrespective of their radii.  This is the
reusable primitive that produces the witness packet's `circles_ne` field: the exact
cap class `⟨v₁, r₁⟩` and the selected class `⟨s, rₛ⟩` are distinct circles because the
Moser apex `v₁` and the strict cap-interior centre `s` are distinct points
(`v₁ ≠ s`). -/

/-- **U2 base-chord witness packet** — `U2a2-1b4c2e2d3f0`/`d3f1a`.  The
shared-base two-circle configuration on point set `A`: the exact `v₁`-centred
cap class (`SelectedClass A v₁ r₁`) and a selected `s`-class
(`SelectedClass A s rₛ`) are *distinct* circles; the two base endpoints `e₁`,
`e₂` (distinct, the shared chord) lie in *both* classes; and a strict
large-member witness `w` lies in both classes while sitting *off* the chord
(`signedArea2 e₁ e₂ w ≠ 0`). -/

/-- **U2 base-chord contradiction** — `U2a2-1b4c2e2d3f1c`/`d3f1d`.  A base-chord
witness packet is impossible: its exact cap class and selected class are two
distinct circles sharing the base chord `e₁`–`e₂`, so they admit no third common
point off the chord, yet the packet records exactly such a witness `w`.
