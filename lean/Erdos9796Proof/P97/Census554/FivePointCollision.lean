# A five-point collision core

Two equilateral triangles on a common edge have either the same third vertex
or opposite third vertices.  In the opposite case, an additional bisector
equality identifies a fifth point with an endpoint of the common edge.  This
gives a reusable equality-closure core for Census-554 patterns.

The theorem layer is independent of the ambient label type and does not assert
coverage of the Census-554 bank.
