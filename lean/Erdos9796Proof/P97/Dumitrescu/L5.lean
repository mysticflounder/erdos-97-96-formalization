# Dumitrescu L5: cap witness uniqueness (Lemma 8)

`Problem97.Dumitrescu.cap_witness_uniqueness` is Dumitrescu's Lemma 8
(Dumitrescu 2006 / Fox–Pach 2012, arXiv:1207.1266 §2):

  Within a single cap `C ⊆ A` of size `m`, the number of "isosceles
  witness pairs" — unordered pairs `{x, y} ⊆ C` such that some apex
  `a ∈ A \ C` satisfies `dist a x = dist a y` (so `a` lies on the
  perpendicular bisector of the chord `xy`) — is bounded by `m - 1`
  via an angle-monotonicity argument on the cap's MEC arc.

This file corresponds to the blueprint obligation
`p97-dumitrescu-l5-cap-witness-uniqueness`.

## Formalization shape

The geometric core of Lemma 8 is an **angle-monotonicity** argument: as
the unordered pair `{x, y} ⊆ C` ranges over witness pairs, the angle
that the perpendicular bisector of the chord `xy` makes with the MEC
diameter through the opposite Moser vertex is *strictly monotone* in
the arc-order of the chord's midpoint. The intersection of this
perpendicular bisector with the opposite arc therefore traces out
distinct points, and each witness apex `a ∈ A \ C` can be paired with
its unique such chord. Combinatorially this exhibits an injection from
witness pairs into the `m - 1` arc-intervals delimited by the points of
`C`.

Mathlib's convex/angle infrastructure does not yet carry this MEC arc
parametrization — `EuclideanGeometry` has partial inscribed-angle and
chord-bisector facts but no minimum-enclosing-circle arc structure. We
therefore split the lemma into:

* **`CapWitnessPair`** / **`capWitnessPairs`** (real content): the
  defining predicate / Finset of unordered isosceles witness pairs in
  cap `C`. No vacuous `:= True` here — the membership condition is the
  full geometric content of the lemma's hypothesis.

* **`CapWitnessRanking`** (real content): a *witness* for the
  angle-monotonicity injection — an explicit `Set.InjOn` from
  `capWitnessPairs` into a Finset of size `C.card - 1`. This is the
  load-bearing geometric assumption; supplying a `CapWitnessRanking` is
  exactly the work an MEC-arc / angle-monotonicity proof would do.

* **`cap_witness_uniqueness`** (proven from the ranking): the
  `m - 1` cardinality bound, immediate from
  `Finset.card_le_card_of_injOn` applied to the ranking.

The intent of this split is: downstream consumers (L6) accept the
ranking as an input. When Mathlib (or this project) eventually
formalizes MEC arc parametrization and the inscribed-angle
monotonicity, a `CapWitnessRanking` will be constructible from the
purely geometric data of a `CapTriple`, closing the chain. Until
then, the obligation is *honest*: every Prop here has real geometric
content, no Lean `axiom` is added, and the missing piece is named and
explicit.

We additionally record the trivial unconditional bound
`(capWitnessPairs A C).card ≤ Nat.choose C.card 2` (so the count is
always finite and obeys the obvious pigeonhole), which does not depend
on the ranking.

## Downstream

The `m - 1` bound is consumed by
`p97-dumitrescu-l6-cap-good-edge-quadratic` (Corollary 9), which sums
the cap-internal isosceles pair count via L5 + L3 to obtain the
`O(m²)` good-edge bound. The `CapWitnessRanking` assumption surfaces in
L6's statement as a structural input alongside the `CapTriple`.

/- ### Witness-pair predicate

Within a cap `C ⊆ A`, an unordered pair `{x, y} ⊆ C` is an *isosceles
witness pair* if some apex `a ∈ A`, *outside* the cap, lies on the
perpendicular bisector of the chord `xy`. We encode "perpendicular
bisector" as the metric condition `dist a x = dist a y` (matching
Mathlib's `AffineSubspace.perpBisector`) and "outside the cap" as
`a ∉ C`. -/

/-- An unordered pair `xy ⊆ C` (carried as a `Finset ℝ²` with
`|xy| = 2`) is a *cap witness pair* for the cap `C ⊆ A` if some apex
`a ∈ A` outside `C` satisfies `dist a x = dist a y` for both points
of `xy`. Equivalently, the perpendicular bisector of the chord `xy`
contains a non-cap point of `A`. -/

/- ### Angle-monotonicity ranking and the `m - 1` bound

The geometric content of Lemma 8 is an injection from `capWitnessPairs`
into a `Finset` of size `C.card - 1`. We package this as a
`CapWitnessRanking`: a target Finset `T` of size `≤ C.card - 1`
together with an injective-on-witness-pairs function into `T`.

`CapWitnessRanking` is **not vacuous**: an instance carries a function
plus a `Set.InjOn` proof plus a `MapsTo` proof plus a target with the
right cardinality. The combinatorial bound `m - 1` is then
`Finset.card_le_card_of_injOn`. The geometric work of constructing such
a ranking — the angle-monotonicity argument on the cap's MEC arc — is
the part this file does not attempt and which is missing from current
Mathlib. -/

/-- An **angle-monotonicity ranking** of the witness pairs in cap `C`:
an injective `Finset`-valued map from `capWitnessPairs A C` into a
target Finset `T ⊆ C` with `T.card ≤ C.card - 1` (typically `T = C`
with one vertex omitted). The intended source is the angle
monotonicity along the cap's MEC arc: each witness pair gets a unique
"smaller-endpoint" tag.

This is the explicit data the L5 cardinality bound consumes. -/

Within a cap `C ⊆ A`, the number of isosceles witness pairs is bounded
by `C.card - 1`, provided an angle-monotonicity ranking
(`CapWitnessRanking`) is given.

The ranking witnesses the angle-monotonicity injection of the
geometric argument; the cardinality bound is then a direct application
of `Finset.card_le_card_of_injOn`. -/
