This repository contains the manuscript and a complete, single-file Lean 4 formalization of constructions giving negative answers to [Erdős problem 96](https://www.erdosproblems.com/96), [problem 97](https://www.erdosproblems.com/97), and the general conjecture that some universal bound on equal-distance multiplicity holds at a suitably chosen vertex of every convex polygon.

## Main result

Write $u(P)$ for the number of unordered unit-distance pairs in a finite planar set $P$, and $\delta_1(P)$ for the minimum number of unit-distance neighbours at any vertex.

For every sufficiently large integer $n$ and every $0<\eta<1/2$, there is an $n$-point set $P$ in strictly convex position such that

```math
\min\left\lbrace\delta_1(P),\frac{u(P)}{n}\right\rbrace
\ge \frac14\log_2\log_2 n-7\log_2\log_2\log_2 n.
```

The points can all lie in the union of the two open disks of radius $\eta$ centred at $(0,-1/2)$ and $(0,1/2)$. The threshold for $n$ is independent of $\eta$. The full unit-distance graph is bipartite, with its classes separated by the horizontal axis.

Consequently:

- **Problem 96:** the maximum number of unit distances among vertices of a convex $n$-gon is $\Omega(n\log\log n)$, so it is not $O(n)$.
- **Problem 97:** a strictly convex polygon exists in which every vertex has at least four other vertices at distance exactly one.
- **General fixed-k conjecture:** for every integer $k\ge1$ and every sufficiently large $n$, there is such a polygon with at least $k$ unit-distance neighbours at every vertex.

The manuscript also gives the explicit upper bound $3432\cdot2^{36036}$ on the number of vertices needed for a counterexample to problem 97. This is a cardinality bound; the construction uses an existence argument for the coordinates.

## Verify the Lean proof

Install [Lean through elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan), then run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Leeham06972452/erdos-96-97.git
cd erdos-96-97
lake exe cache get
lake build
```

The first run downloads the pinned toolchain and Mathlib dependencies. The cache command retrieves Mathlib's compiled library files. The default build target is `Erdos9697Complete`.

To run the proof file directly and display its axiom-audit messages, use:

```sh
lake env lean Erdos9697Complete.lean
```

The build environment is pinned to:

| Component | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Lean | `leanprover/lean4:v4.33.1` |
| Mathlib | [`0df444a360eaa60ab8c11dca51a86af692955474`](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/commit/0df444a360eaa60ab8c11dca51a86af692955474), the `v4.33.1` release |
| Transitive dependencies | Exact revisions in `lake-manifest.json` |

The supplied proof was checked locally on 13 September 2026 with this Lean/Mathlib combination. Its final section audits the transitive axiom dependencies of 33 results and fails if any depends on an axiom outside `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`. This includes rejecting `sorryAx`. The only import is `Mathlib`; the problem definitions are reproduced in the file without importing unproved conjectures.

The [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/lean.yml) builds the proof on pushes and pull requests. The badge above reports the current workflow status.

## Build the PDF

The checked-in [PDF](96-97.pdf) is compiled from [96-97.tex](96-97.tex). With a LaTeX distribution and `latexmk` installed:

```sh
latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error 96-97.tex
```

Alternatively, [Tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/) downloads the required TeX resources and handles the reference-resolution passes:

```sh
tectonic 96-97.tex
```

The PDF included in the initial upload was built with Tectonic 0.17.0. Generated LaTeX auxiliary files and local Lean build products are excluded by `.gitignore`.
